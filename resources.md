I also read the book **Game Programming Patterns** by Robert Nystrom. Very easy to read and to go through...

To learn Go, I think the best resource is the [tour](https://tour.golang.org/), the [effective go page](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) then their [official blog](https://blog.golang.org/).
If you want some concise and quickly resource there's also the book **The Go Programming Language** by Alan Donovan and Brian Bernighan.
